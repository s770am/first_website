    <div class = "img_para about_me">
<p>My name is Dovid Rabinowitz. I am 20 years old. My favorite color is red, especially a dark red. I like to read read books about history and philosophy. I started looking into coding about 2 years ago. At that time, I was busy getting my rabinacal degree and did not have time to learn coding properly. During my free time i would try learn some new code and play around with what i knew. I used to use free code camp and umdemy for courses. Now I am taking Adaleg's bootcamp for full stack development. Since I started the course I feel the coding concepts making more sence and my confidence increasing to work through problems. My goal is to be working as a developer by next year.</p>
